# GLOBAL SUMMER SCHOOL 2016 - HYPERCITIES 

### MODULE 01: Urban Strategies and Technology

##### _where_ | IaaC, Barcelona
##### _when_ | July 4th-17th, 2016
##### _instructors_ | Aldo Sollazzo, Efilena Baseta

## . brief

Our cities are space-time systems, constantly exchanging information among themselves and each other, mutating and fluctuating in an evolutionary manner. The traditional City lost its clear connection to a single static space location, underlining the emergence of a new elastic territoriality, a new informational order, in which traditional infrastructure networks coexist, and expand, into immaterial connections. A combined combinatorial, evolutionary set of Hyper-ecologies, referring to multiple physical and virtual cities.
Through data exchange and interaction, GSS16 - BCN will explore the connection between multi-territorial cities, collecting and visualizing data into projections, interpretations, actions translated through robotic process of fabrication. This process of materialization will not only be used as an information exchanging system but as a decision making tool for the city, citizens and its environment.
The students will be engaged in an heterogeneous learning process exploring multiple urban strategies, shaping the invisible correlation between space and information. Data collection, Material interpretation, robotic aerial fabrication will be interrelated into a design process interacting with the networked system of the hyper-city.

### 00_DOC

All documentation, presentations, calendars and bibliography goes here.

### 01_CODES
The workshop code is organized in topic-based folders. The current code (and the info in this file) will be updated and integrated as the course unfolds.


### REFERENCES
Some bits and hints of reading for both a theoretical and practical contextualization of the computational strategies developed.
